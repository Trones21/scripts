# 🛠️ Scripts and Utilities

A collection of scripts, tools, and small utilities.

Some are polished, some are experimental.  
Languages, styles, and purposes may vary.

Use whatever is useful.  
Organized loosely by theme.

Some scripts may be referenced in blog posts, videos, or shorts.

Everything is provided as-is.
